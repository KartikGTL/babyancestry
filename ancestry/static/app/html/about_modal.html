        <h1>About Baby Ancestry</h1>

        <p>
            My goal with Baby Ancestry was to strip away all the complicated things involved with family history software,
            and just focus on 2 things: The names of your ancestors, and the stories and pictures that help you get to know them.
            I believe that power comes from knowing your ancestors, and I want this to be easy for anyone to use and understand!
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember that this data comes from FamilySearch. It is the best genealogy database in the world,
            but there can still be errors so double double-check with a family member.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whether Baby Ancestry guides you to the name you give your child, or just helps you be a
            little more acquainted with your ancestors, I will feel like my efforts have been a success.

            Thanks for using Baby Ancestry, and please comment below if you have suggestions for improvements!<br>
            All the best,<br>

            P.S. Check out another project I built,
            <a href="http://www.everaccountable.com" target="_blank">Ever Accountable</a>.
            It helps people stay above pornography on electronic
            devices by reporting activity to a trusted friend. The idea is to give people freedom,
            and hold them accountable for the choices they make. The reviews have been great, and people
            say it brings great strength and trust. In this day and age, just about everyone is affected
            by pornography in some way. Check it out!
