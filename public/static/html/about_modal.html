        <h1>About Baby Ancestry</h1>

        <p>
            My goal with Baby Ancestry was to make it easy to get to know your ancestors and find
            a name for your precious little one! I tried to strip away all the complicated aspects
            of family history, and just focus on 2 things:
            The names of your ancestors, and the stories and pictures that help you get to know them.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            Remember that this data comes from FamilySearch. It is the best genealogy database in the world,
            but there can still be errors, especially as you go back farther.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            Whether Baby Ancestry guides you to the name you give your child, or just helps you be a
            little more acquainted with your ancestors, I will feel like my efforts have been a success.
        </p>

            Thanks for using Baby Ancestry, and please leave your feedback if you have
            comments or suggestions for improvement.<br>

            P.S. Check out another project I built,
            <a href="http://www.everaccountable.com" target="_blank">Ever Accountable</a>.
            It helps people to live above pornography on electronic devices.
            It doesn't block anything, but instead simply holds the person accountable to
            a trusted parent, spouse, or friend. It works really well!
            The reviews have been great, and people
            say it brings great strength and trust. In this day and age,
            just about everyone is affected
            by pornography in some way.
